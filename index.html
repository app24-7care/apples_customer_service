            <p>You can sign up for the Apple One bundling service on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. </p>
            <li>Apple One lets you bundle several Apple services together for a lower monthly price.</li>
            <li>It costs about $15 to $30 a month, and what you get depends on the tier level you choose.</li>
            <li>You may need to update your Mac or iPhone to sign up for Apple One.</li>
            <p>If you're subscribed to multiple Apple services, or you want to be, Apple One may be a more affordable option. There are three plans to choose from, each offering different perks. </p>

                <h1>What is Apple One?
                </h1>
            <p>Apple One is a subscription that lets you pay a single price for multiple existing Apple services, like Apple Music, Apple TV+, and extra iCloud storage. </p>    
        <p>There are multiple plans to choose from to suit different needs. Compared to paying for the individual services included in the subscription, it can be more convenient and save you money.</p>

                <h1>What to know about Apple One plans

                </h1>
                <p>Apple One offers three plans:

                </p>
                <li>Individual plan ($14.95 per month): You'll have Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and 50 GB of iCloud storage. As its name implies, the plan is suited for a single person.</li>
                <li>Family plan ($19.95 per month): You'll have all the same services as the individual plan, 200 GB of iCloud Storage, and the ability to share your plan with up to five other people. That's enough for you, your spouse, kids, and grandma, too.</li>
                <li>Premier plan ($29.95 per month): The top-tier plan gives you the same services as the family and individual plans, 2 TB of iCloud Storage, Apple Fitness+ and Apple News+. You can share this plan with up to five other people. If you're an avid runner, have a family and thousands of files, this plan will suit you.</li>
                <p>Pick a plan based on whatever your needs are — you can always upgrade or downgrade your plan later if those needs change. 

                </p>
            
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>It’s worth noting that Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade can always be shared with your family, whether you subscribe separately or with an individual Apple One plan. Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ also support family sharing.</p>

                 <p class="text-justify">Workout subscription services grew popular at the start of the pandemic, as people could no longer visit the gym. Apple Fitness+ offers various workout types, from yoga to strength training, audio-guided walks and runs, and meditations, along with plenty of real-time metrics. It works via the Fitness app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, and it requires an Apple Watch Series 3 or newer. You can read more about it in our review, but the service has since expanded. (Apple adds around 30 new workouts and meditations every week.)

                    <h1>What About Free Trials and Existing Subscriptions?
                    </h1>
                    <p>You can get a one-month free trial of Apple One. If you are a new subscriber and have no existing subscriptions or free trials for any of these services, you get everything for free for one month and then start paying the monthly fee.
    
                    </p>
                    <p>If you have existing subscriptions or free trials running, things get a little more complicated. If you already subscribe to some of the services in Apple One, those subscriptions will continue, and you will get the others for free for one month. At the end of the month, your current individual subscriptions will automatically be canceled, and you'll start paying the Apple One plan price for everything.
    
                    </p>
                    <p>What if you scored a free trial of Apple TV+ for three months, or you have six free months of Apple Music through an offer you redeemed? Unfortunately, Apple One will cut those free trials down to the standard one-month period, after which you will start to pay the Apple One plan price you chose. Note: You don’t get any free trial allowance back if you cancel your Apple One plan.

                    <h1>How to Enable Apple One Subscription on Your iPhone
                    </h1>
                    <p>Apple One subscription just went live and now you can subscribe to them on your iPhone. I like the fact that Apple has made it very easy to subscribe to Apple One. But if you don’t know where to look, you won’t find the Apple One subscription option. There are also a few things that you should know before you subscribe. That’s why, in this article, we bring you a step by step guide that you can follow to enable Apple One Subscription on your iPhone.</p>
                    <h3>Enable Apple One Subscription on Your iPhone
                    </h3>
                    <p>Ironically, Apple One subscription comes in different tiers. The plans also vary depending on your region as services like Apple Fitness+ and News+ are not available outside the US. If you want to get all the pricing details, follow our linked Apple One launch article to find it. With that said, let’s get to the tutorial, shall we?

                    </p>
                    <p>1. Open the Settings app and tap on your name.

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Here, tap on Subscriptions.

                    </p>
                    <p>3. Now, you should see the “Get Apple One” option at the top. Tap on it.

                    </p>
                    <p>4. Here, you will see the different tiers available to you. Select the one you want and then tap on “Start a free trial”</p>
                   <p>Since I am living in India, I don’t get the premium option as News+ and Fitness+ are not available here. So, I only get the Individual and Family plans. Your choices will vary depending on your region.

                   </p>
                   <h3>Things to Keep in Mind
                </h3>

                <p>Here are things you should keep in mind while subscribing to Apple One.

                </p>
                <li>You get a 1-month free trial even if you are already subscribed to different Apple services. This is a nice thing as you get to test the plans and upgrade or downgrade before the billing starts.</li>
                <li>Your existing subscriptions to Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and Apple News+ will automatically merge with the new plan. You don’t have to cancel them individually.</li>
                <li>However, since you might want to buy extra iCloud storage (you only get 50GB in the standard plan), this is not merged. In my testing, my iCloud subscription for 50GB was still live, and I ended up having 100GB of iCloud storage. So make sure to cancel the iCloud subscription if you don’t need it.</li>
                <h1>Subscribe to Apple One on your iPhone
                </h1>
                <p>So, that is how you can subscribe to Apple One on your iPhone. As you can see, the steps are easy. Still, if you had some problem, let us know in the comments below, and we will help you out. Lastly, remember to cancel the iCloud subscription if you don’t need it to prevent double billing.
